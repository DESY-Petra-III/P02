Right work with TANGO and Keithley 3706:
K3706 - accepts only 1 connection at a time (simultaneous working is impossible!!!)

correct protocol:
 - check device state and state of adm device
	 - both services should be hard wired into program - no device polling
 
 - if no adm service - ask user to start the service through tango
 - if adm is on, but "set measurement" does not set the correct parameter or device is off:  
	- ask user to restart Keithley and restart the adm server
	- cannot start tango service through commands so far
 - report to the user if device is available
