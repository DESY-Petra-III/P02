Files and Directories:
./.gnuplot 		- file for initialization of our gnuplot stack scripts, key bindings, etc.
			intended position : ~/.gnuplot
./gnuplot 		- directory with main scripts (calculation, etc.)
			intended position : ~/gnuplot
./deploy_gnuplot.sh	- file for deployment at the beamline or desired location
./scan_examples 	- directory with examples of .fio scan files


USAGE:
1. Install correct version of the gnuplot.
2. Use Linux or CygWin (gnuplot scripts take advantage of system command line)
3. Move '.gnuplot' file to '~/.gnuplot' and 'gnuplot' folder to '~/gnuplot'
4. Change current working directory to the directory with DORIS Online .fio files (at least 1 file by the name "hasylab*.fio should exist)
5. start gnuplot and enjoy

1.0 Use ./deploy_gnuplot.sh script to do the steps 1 to 3

Help for the scripts is available trough F1 key binding in the gnuplot
